# This file lists project requirements that should be installed into a `lib`
# directory that gets uploaded to GAE. Run 'pip install -t lib -r
# requirements_gae.txt' to install these dependencies in `lib/` subdirectory,
# which will ensure they are uploaded to GAE (a few libraries not provided by
# Google).
#
# Note: The `lib` directory is added to `sys.path` by `appengine_config.py`.
# If working in a virtualenv, add lib to your virtualenv path by adding a
# file with a .pth extension to the virualenv site-packages, .e.g `gae.pth`.
# The contents of gae_lib.pth should be nothing more than a path to the lib/
# directory, either relative or absolute works. E.g. mine is:
#
# ```gae_lib.pth
# ../../../icw/lib/
# ```
#
# Alternatively, just symlink to the gae_lib.pth included in the repo
# `ln -s $PWD/gae_lib.pth $PWD/../lib/python2.7/site-packages/`
#
# pip install -t lib -r requirements_gae.txt
